# CNC-Machine-Output-Analysis-and-Prediction

In this project, I Will use an existing dataset of machining
parameters and corresponding outputs (surface roughness,
cutting forces, and tool wear).

I will use various machine learning algorithms to develop
models that predict surface roughness, cutting forces, and tool
wear. We'll start with linear regression and then try decision tree
and random forest models.

To evaluate the models, we’ll use metrics like mean squared
error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared. We’ll
compare the models and choose the best one for each output
parameter.

I will use the best ML model to classify the tear condition
(T_cond) of the tool, based on other physical parameters.

# **OBJECTIVES**

The primary objective of this project is to develop accurate
machine-learning models that can predict the final diameter,
cutting forces and tool wear.

To explore various machine learning algorithms to develop
models for predicting.

To evaluate the performance of the developed models using
various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

To compare the performance of different machine learning
algorithms and select the best-performing algorithm for each
output parameter.

# Dataset
Made in the COMPETENCE CENTER IN MANUFACTURING (CCM), a laboratory of the AERONAUTICS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (ITA).
